    {level:'A1',title:'Story 1: A Casual Office Conversation',context:'Codzienna rozmowa w biurze',en:`"Hey, did you get the invoice from the supplier?" Tom asked, leaning over his desk. "Yes, but the payment hasn't been processed yet," Anna replied. "We signed the contract last week, but the deadline is tomorrow — and I still haven't sent the attachment." Tom sighed. "Let's call a quick meeting to sort this out. Do you have the agenda ready?" Anna nodded. "My task is to prepare the schedule for the whole project, but first I have a question about the purpose of the new term in the process." Tom smiled. "Don't worry. The agreement is simple. Just read the document and reply to the inquiry by noon."`,pl:''},
    {level:'A1',title:'Story 2: A Professional Email',context:'E-mail biznesowy',en:`Subject: Invoice #2045 -- Payment Confirmation Dear Mr. Roberts, I hope this message finds you well. Please find the invoice attached to this email. The payment should be completed before the contract deadline, which falls on the 28th of this month. I have also included the agenda for our upcoming meeting as an attachment. Your task at this stage is to review the document and confirm that the position of our company in this agreement is clearly stated. The purpose of this inquiry is to ensure we follow the correct process and keep the project schedule on track. Please let me know if you have any questions regarding the term or the solution we proposed. Kind regards, Sarah`,pl:''},
    {level:'A1',title:'Story 3: A Stressful Day at Work',context:'Stresujący dzień w pracy',en:`It was Monday morning, and everything was going wrong. The invoice had an error — the payment amount didn't match the contract. The deadline was in three hours, and nobody could find the attachment. James called an emergency meeting without even preparing an agenda. "This is a task for the whole team," he said, frustrated. "The purpose of this project is to deliver a solution on schedule, and right now we're failing." His position in the company felt shaky. The question lingered: could they fix the process in time? They needed a new agreement, a revised document, and an urgent inquiry to the client — all before the term ended.`,pl:''},
    {level:'A1',title:'Story 4: A Science Project at School',context:'Projekt naukowy w szkole',en:`The students gathered for a meeting to plan their science project. Their teacher handed out the agenda and assigned each student a task. "The purpose of this project," she explained, "is to find a solution to plastic pollution." The document they prepared included a schedule, a process description, and a question section for future inquiry. One student asked about the term 'biodegradable' and how it related to their project. The group worked hard to ensure every position was covered in the agreement they made with each other. By the end of the day, the invoice for materials was submitted and payment was arranged. The deadline was two weeks away — plenty of time.`,pl:''},
    {level:'A2',title:'Story 1: A Team Update Call',context:'Rozmowa w zespole projektowym',en:`"Before we start, let me remind everyone: the minutes from last week's call are still outstanding," said Maria. "I'll circulate them by end of day." She clicked to the next slide. "Now, let me elaborate on the timeline. We've reached the first milestone, but the data we collected indicates a risk in the next phase." She paused. "From a compliance perspective, we need to identify what actions are appropriate and define clear deliverables." James raised his hand. "Can we extend the deadline for the revision?" Maria nodded. "That's a reasonable proposal. I do have one reservation, though — the rate of progress needs to increase. The clause about delivery dates in the contract is strict."`,pl:''},
    {level:'A2',title:'Story 2: A Finance Email',context:'E-mail finansowy',en:`Subject: Outstanding Invoice -- VAT Compliance Dear Finance Team, I am writing to remind you of the outstanding invoice from April, which includes VAT at the standard rate. The timeline for payment was agreed upon in the clause of our original contract. The data we have indicate that this payment is now overdue. I would like to propose an action plan: first, define the outstanding amount; second, identify any compliance issues; third, circulate the revised invoice to all appropriate parties. Our proposal is to extend the notice period by two weeks, which would give both sides time for a proper revision. Please elaborate on your reservation regarding this approach, and let me know if an increase in the instalment is necessary. We can meet the first milestone together. Regards, Kate`,pl:''},
    {level:'A2',title:'Story 3: A Difficult Negotiation',context:'Trudna negocjacja',en:`The room was tense. The outstanding amount was significant, and both sides had reservations. "The rate we agreed on doesn't reflect the VAT increase," said the supplier's representative. "I'd like to elaborate on the clause in question." The client's team exchanged glances. "From our perspective," said the lead negotiator, "the compliance requirements define what is appropriate. The data indicate that your deliverables have not met the milestone targets." She placed a document on the table. "This is a revised proposal. We need you to circulate it to your legal team, identify the risk areas, and provide minutes from your board meeting. We can extend the timeline, but not indefinitely. I must remind you: the notice period is part of the action plan."`,pl:''},
    {level:'A2',title:'Story 4: A Research Study Overview',context:'Badania naukowe',en:`The scientists gathered to discuss the study's timeline and deliverables. The data collected over six months helped identify key risk factors associated with the increase in air pollution rates. "We need to elaborate on the methodology," said Dr. Lee. "The compliance with ethical standards is non-negotiable." She reminded the team to circulate the latest revision of the report before the next milestone. "The minutes from last week's meeting indicate that appropriate actions need to be taken." A junior researcher raised a reservation: "Is it appropriate to extend the study?" Dr. Lee shook her head. "Our proposal is clear. We must define the next phase and remind the funding body about the VAT clause in the budget agreement."`,pl:''},
    {level:'B1',title:'Story 1: A Corporate Strategy Meeting',context:'Spotkanie strategiczne w firmie',en:`Although the pressure was intense, the management team gathered to convene a crucial planning session. The scope of the discussion was broad: how to achieve growth, reduce costs, and ensure long-term accountability. "We need to address the trend toward merging smaller divisions," said the CFO. "Nevertheless, any transaction of this kind must comply with the latest regulation." The CEO nodded. "Let's take an analytical approach. The assessment shows that consolidating our operations would benefit the company, but we must manage the risks." A dispute had been escalating between two departments, and the conflict was threatening to reduce productivity. "Our duty," said the HR Director, "is to facilitate cooperation and improve governance. We need a contingency plan — a clear procedure that assigns liability and ensures transparency." The team agreed to conduct a full audit before making any adjustments.`,pl:''},
    {level:'B1',title:'Story 2: A Legal Case Discussion',context:'Dyskusja prawna',en:`"The accusation is serious," said the lawyer, reviewing the evidence. "Although there is no precedent, we can't dismiss the valid concerns raised in the hearing." The client looked nervous. "Could this escalate into a lawsuit?" "It's possible," she admitted. "Nevertheless, we plan to address this through arbitration first. Our approach will be to interpret the regulation carefully, reduce the scope of liability, and negotiate a fair compensation." She outlined the procedure: gather qualitative and quantitative data, conduct an independent assessment, and adapt the strategy based on findings. "The essential thing is accountability. The company must consistently demonstrate transparency in every transaction." She paused. "We have a concern about the governance structure. An intervention may be required. The control mechanisms are not working as planned, and this stage of the conflict could benefit from external mediation."`,pl:''},
    {level:'B1',title:'Story 3: A Career Conversation Between Colleagues',context:'Luźna rozmowa o karierze',en:`"I've been thinking about my career progression a lot lately," said Mark, sipping his coffee. "The environment here has become very tight — the workload is huge and it's hard to remain productive." Sarah nodded. "I know what you mean. Although the company benefits are good, the pressure is constant." "I tried to negotiate a salary adjustment, but they couldn't achieve a consensus. It felt like every concern I raised just escalated." "That's frustrating," Sarah said. "Have you considered a different approach? Something more results-oriented?" Mark shrugged. "I'm trying to adapt. I want to manage my workload better, improve my analytical skills, and plan a clearer path forward." "Set measurable goals," Sarah suggested. "Qualitative and quantitative. That way, you can address each stage of your progression with evidence. And make sure your manager pays attention — accountability matters."`,pl:''},
    {level:'B1',title:'Story 4: A Crisis Management Scenario',context:'Zarządzanie kryzysowe',en:`The company was on the verge of bankruptcy. Although the CFO had tried to consolidate the accounts, the debt had escalated beyond control. An audit revealed crucial irregularities: transactions without valid documentation, no governance procedure in place, and evidence of poor planning at every stage. "We have a duty to address this," said the board chair. "The accusation of financial misconduct must be taken seriously." An intervention was planned. The approach: reduce liability, negotiate compensation for affected parties, and convene a hearing. "Nevertheless, we must comply with every regulation," said the lawyer. "The arbitration may set a precedent." The team agreed to conduct a qualitative and quantitative assessment, adapt their contingency plan, and facilitate cooperation between all departments. "The essential measure," concluded the CEO, "is transparency — consistently and without exception." The company needed to merge with a partner or face a lawsuit. Attention was focused on one thing: survival.`,pl:''},
    {level:'B2',title:'Story 1: A Board Room Situation',context:'Sytuacja w sali zarządu',en:`The meeting was adjourned briefly after a heated discussion. In light of the recent regulatory examination, the board had decided to refocus their attention on governance. "The analysis reveals a significant gap in our compliance framework," said the Chief Risk Officer. "Furthermore, the disparity between reported results and actual performance is a serious matter." She recommended implementing an enhanced oversight structure and suggested the company formalise its cross-functional review process. "The reputational damage from this issue could be severe. Our exposure is real." The CEO agreed that the position of the company was fragile. "We need due diligence. Let's revise all confidential correspondence, support the regulatory investigation, and reach a settlement before this becomes a breach of our obligations." The reaction from shareholders, she noted, had been swift. "A compromise is needed. Our track record must be rebuilt through expertise and transparent communication."`,pl:''},
    {level:'B2',title:'Story 2: A Professional Email on a Sensitive Issue',context:'E-mail w sprawie wrażliwej',en:`Subject: Confidential -- Reputational Matter Dear Legal Team, Further to our discussion yesterday, I am writing to formalise our position on this matter. In light of the examination conducted last week, the analysis reveals a significant disparity in our regulatory filings. Furthermore, the breach of confidentiality by one of our contractors represents a compelling and insufficient response to the oversight issue we raised earlier. I recommend we implement an enhanced review process and revise our correspondence policy immediately. The gap identified in our due diligence procedure must be addressed without compromise. Our track record in handling such issues is strong, and I am confident that cross-functional expertise will support us in reaching a fair settlement. Please refocus all efforts on this issue and ensure all correspondence remains strictly confidential. The reputational exposure from this development could result in significant damage if not managed prudently. Regards, Director of Compliance`,pl:''},
    {level:'B2',title:'Story 3: A Casual Chat About Work Challenges',context:'Rozmowa w pracy o trudnościach',en:`"Did you hear about the settlement?" whispered David during the coffee break. "Yeah," said Priya. "Apparently, the analysis revealed a significant gap in the company's due diligence process. There was a breach of the confidentiality agreement — not a great result." David shook his head. "Furthermore, the regulatory examination showed a disparity between what was reported and what actually happened. The reputational damage is real." "And the reaction from clients?" Priya asked. "Not great. Some are reconsidering their position." "What are they doing about it?" "They're revising the correspondence, implementing new oversight procedures, and trying to formalise the cross-functional process." He sighed. "It's a complex matter. In light of everything, I think the most prudent move would be to reach a compromise with the affected parties and refocus energy on rebuilding the track record. Our expertise should support that."`,pl:''},
    {level:'B2',title:'Story 4: A Research Team Debrief',context:'Debriefing zespołu badawczego',en:`The cross-functional research team met to review the result of a six-month study. The analysis was clear: there was a significant gap in the existing treatment approach, and the disparity between expected and actual outcomes was compelling. "In light of this examination, we recommend implementing an enhanced protocol," said Dr. Patel. "Furthermore, we need to revise how we handle confidential patient data." The team agreed. "The issue," said a colleague, "is regulatory exposure. A breach of data confidentiality — even inadvertent — could result in serious reputational damage." The committee had adjourned the previous discussion without a resolution, but now there was momentum. "We must formalise our oversight procedures, close the gap, and support a culture of transparency." The matter of due diligence was critical. The team's track record spoke for itself — now they needed to refocus and implement.`,pl:''},
    {level:'C1',title:'Story 1: A High-Stakes Legal Deliberation',context:'Prawna dyskusja na wysokim szczeblu',en:`The counsel rose to address the court. "The claim rests on unsubstantiated allegations," she began. "Notwithstanding the material disclosed, there are no admissible grounds to compel an admission of liability." The judge's posture was unreadable. The opposing counsel's stance was, from a legal lens, untenable — the interpretation of the statutory provision had been overstated, the significance of the evidence misconstrued. "To that end," she continued, "we formally reserve the right to seek an equitable remedy under the indemnity provisions." She paused, her delivery considered and measured. "The escalation of this matter — driven by inaction on their part — has compelled us to spearhead this initiative." Upon consideration of the fiduciary obligation and the non-compete clause in question, it was clear the acquisition had inadvertently triggered a binding cross-border provision. The judge placed a concern on record: the structural deficiency in the original agreement was concerning. A decisive recalibration was warranted.`,pl:''},
    {level:'C1',title:'Story 2: An Executive Team Email',context:'E-mail w zespole zarządzającym',en:`Subject: Restructuring Initiative -- Mandatory Disclosure and Next Steps Dear Executive Committee, With that in mind, I am writing to formally address the concerning developments surrounding our multi-entity restructuring. Upon consideration of the risk-adjusted assessment, it is clear that inaction is no longer a viable alternative. The structural deficiency in our current coordination mechanism represents an unavoidable obligation we must uphold. Notwithstanding the mixed feelings some of you may have, I remain cautiously optimistic that a mutually beneficial outcome is within reach. To that end, I propose we spearhead a proactive initiative to strengthen our institutional framework and enhance enforceability across all jurisdictions. I was, I must admit, taken aback by the unsubstantiated allegation raised during last week's deliberation. Nevertheless, we must adhere to the highest standards of scrutiny and safeguard the candidacy of our independent supervisory board members. I would like to place on record that the shortcoming identified in the exclusive acquisition clause must be remedied through a decisive and equitable provision. Our counsel will formally reserve all statutory rights and mitigate any prejudice caused by the escalation. I am impressed by the team's nuanced approach thus far. Regards, CEO`,pl:''},
    {level:'C1',title:'Story 3: A Candid Conversation Between Senior Colleagues',context:'Szczera rozmowa między doświadczonymi kolegami',en:`"I'll be honest," said Rebecca, closing the door. "I have mixed feelings about this." Marcus looked up. "The candidacy or the acquisition?" "Both," she said. "I was taken aback by the board's posture. Frankly, I found the whole deliberation concerning." "To be fair," Marcus replied, "the interpretation of the non-compete clause was nuanced. Counsel had to distinguish between what was admissible and what wasn't." "Still," she said, "I'm cautiously optimistic. With that in mind, I think the restructuring is, upon consideration, a viable path — notwithstanding the insolvency risk." He nodded. "The significance of the cross-border provision shouldn't be overstated, but it does trigger a mandatory disclosure obligation." "And the escalation?" "Unavoidable, given the operational deficiency we identified." Rebecca sighed. "I hope we can mitigate the reputational damage and strengthen the institutional mechanism. Our independent counsel has been impressed by the level of scrutiny so far." "Cautiously optimistic, then?" "Let's say I reserve the right to change my mind."`,pl:''},
    {level:'C1',title:'Story 4: An Academic Paper Abstract',context:'Abstrakt artykułu naukowego',en:`This paper examines the enforceability of cross-border binding provisions within multi-entity corporate restructurings, with particular attention to the structural deficiencies that trigger insolvency risk and compromise fiduciary obligations. Through a nuanced interpretation of statutory and institutional frameworks, we distinguish between viable remedies and those that inadvertently escalate operational shortcomings. Our analysis, conducted through a risk-adjusted lens, reveals that inaction in the face of heightened scrutiny is untenable. The claim that exclusive jurisdiction provisions are overstated in significance is assessed cautiously and found to lack admissible grounds. We identify the unavoidable obligation to adhere to supervisory provisions and reinforce coordination mechanisms. The equitable remedy of indemnity is explored as a mutually beneficial alternative, and we formally place on record our observation that proactive safeguarding measures — spearheaded by independent counsel — are both warranted and decisive. Upon consideration of the existing provisions and with that in mind, we propose a recalibration of the prevailing interpretation to strengthen enforceability across all jurisdictions.`,pl:''},
    {level:'C2',title:'Story 1: A Political Commentary',context:'Komentarz polityczny',en:`The constitutional protections that once safeguarded citizens from the overreach of any single regime appeared increasingly ephemeral in the current political climate. Analysts were quick to juxtapose the foresight of the founding legislature with the systemic failures of modern governance. The prosecution of high-profile officials across multi-jurisdictional boundaries required a comprehensive strategy — one that multinational bodies had long struggled to produce. Critics accused the ruling coalition of being perfidious, making promises in public while quietly undermining the very mechanisms designed to hold them accountable. If governments failed to recalibrate their approach, the systemic erosion of democratic norms would become irreversible.`,pl:''},
    {level:'C2',title:'Story 2: A Corporate Scandal Investigation',context:'Dochodzenie w sprawie skandalu korporacyjnego',en:`The multinational corporation's perfidious conduct had finally come to light. For years, it had operated under a regime designed to obscure financial flows and avoid multi-jurisdictional prosecution. Investigators sought to juxtapose the company's public sustainability pledges with its actual environmental record — a comprehensive exercise that revealed systemic deception at every level. What had seemed like ephemeral controversies turned out to be deeply rooted structural failures. Regulators agreed: they needed to recalibrate their constitutional mandate, exercise greater foresight in monitoring corporate behaviour, and build a far more robust international framework. The prosecution would be complex, but necessary.`,pl:''},
    {level:'C2',title:'Story 3: A Philosophical Discussion Over Coffee',context:'Filozoficzna rozmowa przy kawie',en:`"Do you think morality is ephemeral?" asked Sofia, wrapping both hands around her mug. "Depends on the regime," said Luka, half-smiling. Sofia rolled her eyes. "I'm serious. When you juxtapose ancient constitutional philosophy with modern systemic ethics, the differences are striking." "Or maybe the foresight was always there," Luka replied, "and we just keep failing to recalibrate." "The prosecution of moral failures — whether personal or institutional — never seems comprehensive enough," she mused. "And the multinational nature of our world makes it harder. Multi-jurisdictional accountability is a nightmare." "Perfidious systems tend to persist," said Luka, stirring his coffee slowly, "because those inside them benefit from the ambiguity."`,pl:''},
    {level:'C2',title:'Story 4: A Scientific Report Summary',context:'Podsumowanie raportu naukowego',en:`A comprehensive report published by a coalition of multinational research institutions has called for urgent action to recalibrate climate policy in light of systemic governance failures. The report juxtaposes current carbon reduction commitments against measurable outcomes, revealing a perfidious pattern of underperformance across all major emitting nations. Scientists warn that the constitutional frameworks currently in place lack the foresight required to address multi-jurisdictional environmental challenges. "These policies," the lead author noted, "are ephemeral at best — designed to satisfy political cycles rather than scientific timelines." The prosecution of corporations operating outside agreed environmental standards was identified as a key gap. The report calls on international bodies to move beyond the current regime of voluntary compliance and establish binding, enforceable obligations across all signatories.`,pl:''},
